# YZIP Parser Library

## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in the original production of the Infocom games Arthur, Journey, Shogun and Zork Zero.

## Where did it come from?

This repository was forked from [zil-legacy/zillib-eblong](https://github.com/zil-legacy/zillib-eblong).

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if game files can still be built using the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
